        "definition": "A native or inhabitant of Byzantium, now Constantinople;\n   sometimes, applied to an inhabitant of the modern city of\n   Constantinople.\n   C () C is the third letter of the English alphabet. It is from the\n   Latin letter C, which in old Latin represented the sounds of k, and g\n   (in go); its original value being the latter. In Anglo-Saxon words, or\n   Old English before the Norman Conquest, it always has the sound of k.\n   The Latin C was the same letter as the Greek \/, \/, and came from the\n   Greek alphabet. The Greeks got it from the Ph\/nicians. The English name\n   of C is from the Latin name ce, and was derived, probably, through the\n   French. Etymologically C is related to g, h, k, q, s (and other\n   sibilant sounds). Examples of these relations are in L. acutus, E.\n   acute, ague; E. acrid, eager, vinegar; L. cornu, E. horn; E. cat,\n   kitten; E. coy, quiet; L. circare, OF. cerchier, E. search."
